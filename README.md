# Manan Session - API End Points
Session by Sayantanu Dey to instruct students about the importance of API end points in projects and how to effectively use them.

## How to run:

### Step 1: 
Install Node.js for your system. A simple installer is available for windows. You may search it once and use web blogs if necessary (shouldn't be though).

### Step 2:
Install Mongo DB (Communit Server should do it) on your system. Again, an installer is available for the same. Just google it once.

### Step 3:
Download the project files and head to the directory.

### Step 4:
Open the terminal of your choice.

### Step 5:
Run command:
```
npm install
```
This should import dependancies like express, nodemon present in the package.json file.

### Step 6:
Run command:
```
npm start
```
This will launch the project on your local system.

You will also see an address like "http://localhost:8000/.."
Don't hesitate to copy and open it in your browser and play arround with your code.

Now, you have your own local API end point to use. You can host it on platforms like AWS or Heroku to access the end point over the internet.
